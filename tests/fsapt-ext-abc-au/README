A quick test of F-SAPT with point charges in A, B, and C to make sure nothing broke.

Test case fsapt1 explains the fsapt output files. In addition to what is written there,
the example here generates three output files: Extern_A.xyz, Extern_B.xyz, and Extern_C.xyz.
These files contains the coordinates for the user-defined external potentials. These
coordinates are added to the PDB files generated by running the fsapt.py script.

This is the Bohr analog to fsapt-ext-abc.
